# `Routing layer or folder`

* now it will do two main things for us...
* first it will helps us to correctly re-direct to validation and controller layer..
* second is it will helps us in maintaining the versioning of our api's like /api/v1/users , /api/v2/users and so on.
* there are some framework that implement the routing layer like springboot, ruby etc.
* But express also gives us a mechanism using which we can handle routing which is called expressRouter.
* [expressRouter official docs](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)
* *Use the express.Router class to create modular, mountable route handlers. A Router instance is a complete middleware and routing system; for this reason, it is often referred to as a “mini-app”.*
